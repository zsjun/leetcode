79. Word Search

Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

Example:

board =
[
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]

Given word = "ABCCED", return true.
Given word = "SEE", return true.
Given word = "ABCB", return false.

Constraints:

board and word consists only of lowercase and uppercase English letters.
1 <= board.length <= 200
1 <= board[i].length <= 200
1 <= word.length <= 10^3

思考路程
1 就是类似深度搜索，当搜索不到的时候，返回上一步重新搜索，直到全部搜索完毕，如果没有发现结果，则返回false，否则返回true
